This module exports the classes that define a section of a kickstart file.  A
section is a chunk of the file starting with a %tag and ending with a %end.
Examples of sections include %packages, %pre, and %post.

You may use this module to define your own custom sections which will be
treated just the same as a predefined one by the kickstart parser.  All that
is necessary is to create a new subclass of Section and call
parser.registerSection with an instance of your new class.

                            package name. The installation program defines

                            list. In the package list, the packages marked as

                            template and pulls in various other files with the
                            %include mechanism.

                            Here is an example %packages selection::

                                %packages
                                @X Window System
                                @GNOME Desktop Environment
                                @Graphical Internet
                                @Sound and Video
                                dhcp
                                %end

                            As you can see, groups are specified, one to a line,
                            starting with an ``@`` symbol followed by the full
                            group name as given in the comps.xml file. Groups
                            can also be specified using the id for the group,
                            such as gnome-desktop. Specify individual packages
                            with no additional characters (the dhcp line in the
                            example above is an individual package).

                            The ``@`` prefix is also used to request installation
                            of module streams in the following format::

                                @<module name>:<stream name>/<profile name>

                            Profile name is optional and multiple profiles can be
                            installed by using multiple lines, one per profile.
                            Stream name is only optional only if the given module
                            has a default stream.

                            If there are a module and a group named the same,
                            and no stream name and profile are specified,
                            module will be selected instead of a group.

                            Requesting one module more than once with different
                            streams or not specifying a stream name for a module
                            without a default stream will result in an error.

                            Here is an example %packages selection with modules::

                                %packages
                                @^Fedora Server Edition
                                @nodejs:10
                                @django:1.6
                                @postgresql:9.6/server
                                @mariadb:10.1/server
                                @mysql:5.7/default
                                @scala:2.10/default
                                @gimp:2.10/devel
                                vim
                                %end

                            You can also specify environments using the ``@^``
                            prefix followed by full environment name as given in
                            the comps.xml file.  If multiple environments are
                            specified, only the last one specified will be used.
                            Environments can be mixed with both group
                            specifications (even if the given group is not part
                            of the specified environment) and package
                            specifications.

                            Here is an example of requesting the GNOME Desktop
                            environment to be selected for installation::

                                %packages
                                @^gnome-desktop-environment
                                %end

                            Additionally, individual packages may be specified
                            using globs. For instance::

                                %packages
                                vim*
                                kde-i18n-*
                                %end

                            This would install all packages whose names start
                            with "vim" or "kde-i18n-".

                            You can also specify which packages or groups not to
                            install from the default package list::

                                %packages
                                -autofs
                                -@Sound and Video
                                %end
                            """, epilog="""
                            Group-level options
                            -------------------

                            In addition, group lines in the %packages section
                            can take the following options:

                            ``--nodefaults``

                                Only install the group's mandatory packages, not
                                the default selections.

                            ``--optional``

                                In addition to the mandatory and default packages,
                                also install the optional packages. This means all
                                packages in the group will be installed.
