Base classes for creating commands and syntax version object.

This module exports several important base classes:

    BaseData - The base abstract class for all data objects.  Data objects
               are contained within a BaseHandler object.

    BaseHandler - The base abstract class from which versioned kickstart
                  handler are derived.  Subclasses of BaseHandler hold
                  BaseData and KickstartCommand objects.

    DeprecatedCommand - An abstract subclass of KickstartCommand that should
                        be further subclassed by users of this module.  When
                        a subclass is used, a warning message will be
                        printed.

    KickstartCommand - The base abstract class for all kickstart commands.
                       Command objects are contained within a BaseHandler
                       object.
