Introduction
============
pykickstart is a Python library for manipulating kickstart files.  It
contains a common data representation, a parser, and a writer.  This
library aims to be useful for all Python programs that need to work with
kickstart files.  The two most obvious examples are anaconda and
system-config-kickstart.  It is recommended that all other tools that need
to use kickstart files use this library so that we can maintain equivalent
levels of support across all tools.

The kickstart file format itself has only been defined in a rather ad-hoc
manner.  Various documents describe the format, commands, and their
effects.  However, each kickstart-related program implemented its own
parser.  As anaconda added support for new commands and options, other
programs drifted farther and farther out of sync with the "official"
format.  This leads to the problem that valid kickstart files are not
accepted by all programs, or that programs will strip out options it
doesn't understand so that the input and output files do not match.

pykickstart is an effort to correct this.  It was originally designed to
be a common code base for anaconda and system-config-kickstart, so making
the code generic and easily extendable were top priorities.  Another
priority was to formalize the currently recognized grammar in an easily
understood parser so that files that used to work would continue to.  I
believe these goals have been met.

pykickstart also understands all the various versions of the kickstart syntax
that have been around.  Various releases of Red Hat Linux, Red Hat Enterprise
Linux, and Fedora Core have had slightly different versions.  For the most
part, the basic syntax has stayed the same.  However, different commands have
come and gone and different options have been supported on those commands.
pykickstart allows specifying which version of kickstart syntax you want
to support for reading and writing, allowing you to use one code base to
deal with the full range of kickstart files.

This document will cover how to use pykickstart in your programs and how to
extend the basic parser to get customized behavior.  It includes a
description of the important classes and several working examples.


Getting Started
===============
Before diving into the full documentation, it is useful to see an example
of how simple it is to use the default pykickstart in your programs.  Here
is a code snippet that imports the required classes, parses a kickstart
file, and leaves the results in the common data format.

        #!/usr/bin/python
        from pykickstart.parser import *
        from pykickstart.version import makeVersion

        kshandlers = makeVersion()
        ksparser = KickstartParser(ksandlers)
        ksparser.readKickstart("ks.cfg")

The call to makeVersion() creates a new kickstart handler object for the
specified version.  By default, it creates one for the latest supported
syntax version.  The call to KickstartParser() creates a new parser using
the handler object for dealing with individual commands.  The call to
readKickstart() then reads in the kickstart file and sets values in the
handler.

After this call, you don't need ksparser anymore but you will want to hold
on to kshandlers if you are interested in the contents of the file.  If
you want to do some manipulations and then write out the results to a new
file, that's as simple as:

        outfile = open("out.cfg", 'w")
        outfile.write(kshandlers.__str__())
        outfile.close()


Classes
=======
The important classes that make up pykickstart are spread across a handful
of files.  This section includes a brief outline of the contents of those
classes.  For more thorough documentation, refer to the python doc strings
throughout pykickstart.  In python, you can view these docs strings like
so:

        >>> from pykickstart import parser
        >>> help(parser)
        >>> help(parser.KickstartParser)

constants.py
------------
This file includes no classes, though it does include several important
constants representing various things in a kickstart handler class.  You
should import its contents like so:

        from pykickstart.constants import *


*** EVERYTHING UNDER HERE IS CURRENTLY OUT OF DATE AND SLOWLY BEING
*** REWRITTEN.

data.py
-------
This file contains the classes that make up the common data
representation.  The center of the data format is the KickstartData class,
which contains many attributes representing the values from the input
file.  When a new KickstartData is instantiated, these attributes are set
to appropriate default values.  Some attributes are a simple string or
boolean, while some are a list of other classes or dictionaries.  For the
most part, each lines up with a single kickstart command.

The KickstartLogVolData, KickstartNetworkData, KickstartPartData,
KickstartRaidData, and KickstartVolGroupData classes are contained as list
elements in KickstartData.  Each corresponds to a command that may appear
multiple times.  They exist as separate classes so that attributes are
guaranteed to exist.

There are three different types of scripts - pre, post, and traceback -
but all are represented in the kickstart data by a single list.  The
Script class is contained in parser.py and contains an attribute that may
be used to discriminate between classes.

The install package list, excluded package list, and install groups list
are kept as separate.  Excluded packages have the leading "-" stripped
off, and groups have the leading "@" stripped.

See the class reference at the end of this documentation for a brief
explanation of useful functions in each class.

parser.py
---------
This file represents the bulk of pykickstart code.  At its core is the
KickstartParser class, which is essentially a state machine.  There is one
state for each of the sections in a kickstart file, plus some specialized
ones to make the parser work.  The readKickstart method is the entry point
into this class and is designed to be as generic as possible.  You should
never have to override this method in a subclass.  All the other methods
handle a change into a specific state and may be overridden in a
superclass.

If the KickstartParser encounters an error while reading your input file,
it will raise a KickstartParseError with the line in question.  Examples
of errors include bad options given to section headers, include files not
existing, or headers given for sections that are not recognized (for
instance, typos).

Error messages should call the formatErrorMsg function to be properly
formatted before being sent into an exception.  A properly formatted error
message includes the line number in the kickstart file where the problem
occurred and optionally, a more descriptive message.

The other major class within parser.py is KickstartHeaders.  This makes up
the largest amount of the code and also does the most work as it deals
with processing all the options on all the kickstart commands.
KickstartHandlers.handlers is a dictionary mapping command names to
handling methods.  KickstartParser takes the current command and
dispatches the correct method based on this mapping.  If the command name
maps to None, no method is called and no error is issued, a handy feature
which will be discussed later in this documentation.

Each of the handlers makes use of Python's OptionParser module to parse
command arguments and set values in the KickstartData object.  For this
reason, any subclass of KickstartHandlers must call the superclass's
handler to ensure that the KickstartData is correct.  Our option parsing
code allows commands to be marked as deprecated, which causes a message to
be generated and logged by anaconda.  It also allows marking options as
deprecated or required.

There are a few other minor points to note about KickstartParser and
KickstartHandlers.  When creating a KickstartParser object, you can set
the followIncludes attribute to False if you do not wish for include files
to be looked up and parsed as well.  There are several instances when this
is handy.  The order of instantiation for these objects is fixed, as each
object requires certain ones created before it.  KickstartData must be
first, as KickstartHandlers and KickstartParser require it.
KickstartHandlers must come second, and then finally KickstartParser.
Note that you can pass None in for kshandlers in the special case if you
do not care about handling any commands at all.  As we will see in the
next section, this is useful in one special case.

writer.py
---------
This file contains the class that makes up the Kickstart writer.  The job
of this class is to take a KickstartData object and convert it into a
string.  This string should be a valid kickstart file that can then be
used in any program.  Ideally, it should be the same as the input file
though the order of options may have been shifted, as well as other
cosmetic differences.

It is important to note that KickstartWriter.write returns a string, but
does no file output.  KickstartWriter is laid out similarly to
KickstartParser.  It consists of one handler per command plus special ones
for scripts and packages, plus a list specifying the order these handlers
should be called in.  It is possible to add your own handlers to
KickstartWriter if you are extending kickstart with special commands, as
will be discussed in the next section.

See the class reference at the end of this documentation for a brief
explanation of useful functions in each class.


Extending pykickstart
=====================
By default, pykickstart reads in a kickstart file and sets values in a
KickstartData object.  This is useful for some applications, but not all.
anaconda in particular has some odd requirements for kickstart so it will
be our basis for examples on extending pykickstart.

Only paying attention to one command
------------------------------------
Sometimes, you only want to take action on a single kickstart command and
don't care about any of the others.  anaconda, for instance, supports a
vnc command that needs to be processed well before any of the other
commands.  Remember from earlier that any command mapping to None in the
handlers is skipped.  That makes this fairly easy, then.  All we need to
do is make a specialized KickstartHandlers subclass and hook this into a
regular parser:

	from pykickstart.data import *
	from pykickstart.parser import *

	class VNCHandlers(KickstartHandlers):
		def __init__ (self, ksdata):
			KickstartHandlers.__init__(self, ksdata)
			self.resetHandlers()
			self.handlers["vnc"] = self.doVnc

	ksdata = KickstartData()
	kshandlers = VNCHandlers(ksdata)
	ksparser = KickstartParser(ksdata, kshandlers)
	ksparser.readKickstart("ks.cfg")

Here, we make use of the KickstartHandlers.resetHandlers method.  This
method blanks out every entry in the handlers dictionary.  We then set the
vnc command handler to the default value, which you can easily get from
checking out the pykickstart source.  Then, make an instance of our new
class and pass this to KickstartParser().  When readKickstart is called,
the file will be parsed as usual but only the vnc command will ever be
handled.

You can then check the results by examining ksdata.vnc.

Customized handlers
-------------------
In other cases, you may want to include some customized behavior in your
kickstart handlers.  In this case, you'll still want to create a subclass
of KickstartHandlers, though you will need to make sure your handler calls
the superclass still.

	from pykickstart.data import *
	from pykickstart.parser import *

	class KSHandlers(KickstartHandlers):
		def doBootloader (self, args):
			KickstartHandlers.doBootloader(self, args)
			print "bootloader location = %s" % self.ksdata.bootloader["location"]

	ksdata = KickstartData()
	kshandlers = VNCHandlers(ksdata)
	ksparser = KickstartParser(ksdata, kshandlers)
	ksparser.readKickstart("ks.cfg")

This example is very simple, but you can still see what would be required
for complex cases.  Your handler needs to accept an args argument, which
is a list of arguments provided to the command.  Then, make sure to call
the superclass's method of the same name to set the KickstartData.
Finally, do your specialized behavior.

It is even possible to force your handlers to accept more arguments,
though it is slightly more complicated.  This requires making a subclass
of KickstartParser in addition to KickstartHandlers.

	from pykickstart.data import *
	from pykickstart.parser import *

	class KSHandlers(KickstartHandlers):
		def doBootloader (self, userarg, args):
			KickstartHandlers.doBootloader(self, args)
			print "%s bootloader location = %s" % (userarg, self.ksdata.bootloader["location"])

		...

	class KSParser(KickstartParser):
		def __init__ (self, ksdata, kshandlers, userarg):
			self.userarg = userarg
			KickstartParser.__init__(self, ksdata, kshandlers)

		def handleCommand (self, cmd, args):
			if not self.handler:
				return

			if not self.handler.handlers.has_key(cmd):
				raise KickstartParseError, (cmd + " " + string.join(args))
			else:
				if self.handler.handlers[cmd] != None:
					self.handler.currentCmd = cmd
					self.handler.handlers[cmd](self.userarg,
args)

	ksdata = KickstartData()
	kshandlers = VNCHandlers(ksdata)
	ksparser = KSParser(ksdata, kshandlers, "note: ")
	ksparser.readKickstart("ks.cfg")

Let's examine this example a little more closely.  First, you need to
create a subclass of KickstartParser whose __init__ method stores your
argument.  Then you also need to override handleCommand.  In the
overridden method, the only difference is that on the last line you'll
need to pass your argument.

In your subclassed KickstartHandlers, you will need to make sure every
handler accepts your new argument.  You could possibly get around this
requirement by further modifying handleCommand to strip off your argument
for commands that do not accept it.  However, I'm not demonstrating that
here.  Then, make sure to call the superclass's handler method without any
additional arguments.

Adding a new command
--------------------
Adding support for a new command is fairly straightforward.  You'll need
to create a KickstartHandlers and KickstartWriter subclass and add your
methods to the handler lists.

	from pykickstart.data import *
	from pykickstart.parser import *
	from pykickstart.writer import *

	class SpecialHandlers(KickstartHandlers):
		def __init__ (self, ksdata):
			KickstartHandlers.__init__(self, ksdata)
			self.handlers["log"] = self.doLog

		def doLog (self, args):
			op = KSOptionParser()
			op.add_option("--level", dest="level")
			op.add_option("--host", dest="host")

			(opts, extra) = op.parse_args(args=args)

			self.ksdata.log["level"] = getattr(opts, "level")
			self.ksdata.log["host"] = getattr(opts, "host")

	class SpecialWriter(KickstartWriter):
		def __init__ (self, ksdata):
			KickstartWriter.__init__(self, ksdata)
			self.handlers.insert(1, self.doLog)

		def doLog(self):
			argstr = ""

			if self.ksdata.log["level"]:
				argstr = "--level=%s" % self.ksdata.log["level"]
			if self.ksdata.log["host"]:
				argstr = argstr + "--host=%s" % self.ksdata.log["host"]

			if argstr != "":
				return "log %s" % argstr
			else
				return

	ksdata = KickstartData()
	kshandlers = SpecialHandlers(ksdata)
	ksparser = KickstartParser(ksdata, kshandlers)
	ksparser.readKickstart("ks.cfg")

This is all fairly straightforward, with the possible exception of the
OptionParser stuff.  Without getting into it too much, you'll need to
create a new instance of KSOptionParser, and then use the Python
documentation on how to use it.  It's a very complex, powerful class.
Make sure to set the KickstartData afterwards.

The KickstartWriter object is also pretty simple.  Make sure your method
returns an empty string if there's nothing set on this option, and the
appropriate string otherwise.

Adding a new section
--------------------
Currently, there is no simple way to add a new section.  This requires
adding more code to readKickstart as well as additional states.
readKickstart is not set up to do this sort of thing easily.
