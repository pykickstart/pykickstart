# This script takes as input an optional input kickstart file and an optional
# kickstart syntax version (the latest is assumed, if none specified).  It
# then provides an interactive shell for the user to manipulate the state of
# the input kickstart file and either prints the final results on stdout or to
# a designated output file when the program quits.

# TODO:
# - error reporting always says you are on line 1
# - handle sections like %packages
# - some meta-commands might be nice:
#   - .delete (a previous line)
#   - .help (requires moving help text into each optionparser object?)
#   - .save
